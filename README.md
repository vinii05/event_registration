  - Text, email, and date inputs
  - Radio buttons and dropdown selection
  - Textarea for additional comments

- Basic responsive layout tested by resizing the browser window.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure all media files (e.g., `banner.jpg`, `promo.mp4`, `intro.mp3`) are in the same directory as `event.html`.
3. Open `event.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
